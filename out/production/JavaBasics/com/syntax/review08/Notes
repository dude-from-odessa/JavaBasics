Each object has it is own copy for instance variable.
Static is used to share for all objects.
Static has only one copy
Static variable should be accessed by the static way with class name.

Constructor initialised the objects
Order is matter when we are creating the constructor.
If we don't create constructor Java creates default constructor
When we creates the constructor, java will not create default constructor
If to use local variable for constructor it will be not visible for object, need to use this.

 this keyword - use to refer to the current object
 this.  - used with instance variable
        - used with methods with parent class
 this(names of instance variables for other constructor) - used to call current class constructor

Static method can work with static variable but not with instance variables - rule.
