Set :
  Set is java does not allow duplicate values. There are many types of sets but we
  will only discuss the most widely used ones which are :
  1)HashSet 2)LinkedHashSet 3) TreeSet
HashSet :
  Upside : Most commonly used type of set it is fastest when it comes to insert and
  retrieve the data.
  Downside : Insertion order is not maintained.
  No get method to get a single value.
LinkedHashSet :
  Upside : Insertion order is maintained.
  Downside : Insertion speed is comparable to HashSet but the retrieval speed is the
  slowest.
TreeSet :
  Upside : The Data is stored in the sorted form.
  Downside : Insertion speed is slow. Retrieval speed is better than LinkedHashSet
  but slower than HashSet.
Note :
Mostly used to remove duplicates.
=========================================================================================
Map:
    Allow to store key value pairs. first Entry is treated as key and the second one is
    treated as value. Keys can't be duplicate but values can be.
    Map <Integer, String> items = new HashMap<>();
 There are many types of Maps as sets but we will only discuss 3 of them.
1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap
HashMap :
  it is fastest when it comes to insert and
  retrieve the data.
  Downside : Insertion order is not maintained.
LinkedHashMap :
  Upside : Insertion order is maintained.
  Dowside : insertin speed slower than HashMap, Retrieval speed is slowes of all

 Choose proper DataStructure.
 Q1 : I want to store unique names in the sorted form.
 A  : TreeSet
 Q2 : I want to store the names of the students and most of the time I will be
 performing operation related to data retrieval based on index.
 Arraylist
