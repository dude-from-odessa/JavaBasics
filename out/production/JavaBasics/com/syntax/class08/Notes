loops:

WHILE SYNTAX

	while(condtion) {
		repetative code;
	}

DO WHILE SYNTAX

	do {
		code;
	} while (condition);

when we have to execute code at least 1 time --> then do loop is used

for loop - executes block of code as long as condition is true.
For loop is the BEST choice to use when when know how many times we want/need to repeat block of code.

I want to say GM 5 times.

FOR LOOP SYNTAX

for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement) {

	block of code;
}
---------------------------------------

we use for - when we know in advance how many times we want to iterate block of code

we use while loop - when we do not know number of iterations

		while - first checks the conditon
		do while - executes code at least once before checking the condtion

---------------------------------------
Nested Loops - loop inside another loop

	for(int i=1; i<=3; i++) { //outer loops

		System.out.println("Hello");

	}

	System.out.println("End");
