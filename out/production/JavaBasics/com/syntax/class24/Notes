What is PolyMorphism:
    PolyMorphism is the ability of a method to behave differently depending upon the
    object or parameters that we pass to a method.
    When we pass different parameters to a method and it behaves differently then it is called.
    static PolyMorphism or compile time PolyMorphism or early binding.
    when we achieve the PolyMorphism through method overriding then it is called
    dynamic binding or run time PolyMorphism or late binding
