Access Modifiers:

Access modifiers are keywords in Java that help us control access of classes,
variables and methods and other code of block. There are four access levels in Java
Private default(it's not a keyword) protected and public.
We have three keywords that define these access levels 1) private 2) protected 3) public

Private <=CLASS ACCESS=> :
 When we use the private keyword with a method or field it is only accessible inside that class.
 it is the most restricted access modifier.
Default (its not a keyword)   <=PACKAGE ACCESS=> :
 when we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method then default
 access is applied by java which means we can access this variable or method inside the same as
 well as in all the other classes which exists inside the same package.
Protected <=PACKAGE & RELATIONSHIP ACCESS=> :
 When we have protected access modifier we can access that method or variable inside the same
 class+ inside the other classes which are inside the same package + inside the classes which
 are in different packages as well but they must have extends relationship with the original class.
Public <=PROJECT ACCESS=> :
 When we use the public access modifiers we can use that field or method anywhere inside the same project.
