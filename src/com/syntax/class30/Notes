Map in Java :
    Map is an interface in java that allows us to store key value pairs. Keys can't be duplicate but
    values can be.
    There many different types of maps but we will only discuss 3 of them and will also touch a 4the one.
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashmap 3) TreeMap 4) HashTable(slow and old because of thread safety)

    HashMap :
      Upside   : It's the fastest of all.
      Downside : Does not maintain the insertion order.
    LinkedHashMap :
      Upside   : order is maintain.
      Downside : retrieval is bad
    TreeMap :
      Upside : Data is always stored in the sorted form.
      Downside : insertion speed is slowest of all. Retrieval speed is slower than Hashmap but faster than LinkedHashMap
    HashTable :
      its old and slow but provides thread safety.

Important Note :
We can use three methods to get the data from a map
    1) entrySet() : key, value store inside an object called Map.Entry we can use getKey() method on this object
    to get the key of that entry and getValue() method to get the value of that entry.
    2) keySet() : it will return all the keys from a map in the form of a set.
    3) values() : it will return us all the values from a map in the from of a collection

FileHandling in Java :
    We need to have below things in order to read/write a file Manually.
    1) Path of the file that we want to read/write
    2) We need to navigate to that file.
    3) We need to have a software installed on our computers to interact with that file.

    We need to have below three things in order to read/write a file Manually.
    1) Path of a file we can store inside a String
    2) we can use the FileInputStream/FiledOutputStream class to navigate to that folder.
    3) we can use a specific java class that can handle that file type
    4)
